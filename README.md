# stereo_check
This repository contains a dataset of Italian sentences generated by different LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, Llama3, Phi3mini, Mixtral 8x22), which can be used to determine the incidence of the model in generating sentences containing an explicit gender referent, even when it is instructed by specifying the neutrality of the referent (using "person" in the prompt), and to determine whether the generated sentences are coherent or not with the stereotype (female entity associated with a feminine connoted adjective (FF), male entity associated with a masculine connoted adjective (MM)).

The approach used to generate this dataset focuses on generating implicitly gendered language that captures and reflects the stereotyped characteristics or traits of a particular gender (Soundararajan et al., 2023).

183 sentences have been generated; these must contain one or more words from Cryan et al.'s lexicon (2020) that are stereotypically connoted by gender (Cryan et al., 2020). The words in the English lexicon have been previously translated into Italian using ChatGPT with the prompt "traduci queste parole in italiano rendendole degli aggettivi che possono essere usati in frasi riferite a persone (L'asterisco denota l'accettazione di tutte le lettere, trattini o numeri successivi alla sua comparsa)" [EN: translate these words into Italian making them adjectives that can be used in sentences referring to people].
